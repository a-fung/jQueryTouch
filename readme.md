jQueryTouch
====================

This is a set of jQuery plugins that enables web developers to easily add touch to their web sites. This library supports all modern browsers. It unifies mouse and touch events into a single event type.


Quick start
-----------

Simply download and add `jquery.touch.js` to your website.
Make a call to `$("#touch-target").touchInit()`.
And then `"touch_start"`, `"touch_move"` and `"touch_end"` events will start being triggered from the element.

You can use `$("#touch-target").on("touch_start", handler)` to handle unified touch events.


Browser Support
---------------

- Internet Explorer 9*
- Internet Explorer 10
- Firefox 4+*
- Google Chrome*
- Google Chrome Beta (Version 22)
- Safari 3.2+*
- Opera 12*
- Safari on iOS 2.0+
- Chrome for Android
- Firefox for Android

Browsers with * means they do not support touch and jQueryTouch can still be used to handle mouse click
